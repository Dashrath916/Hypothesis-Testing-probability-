# Hypothesis-Testing-probability

# Assignment Question

## Problem Statement
The average weight of a certain breed of dogs is known to be 25 kilograms with a standard deviation of 3 kilograms. If the weights of these dogs are normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected dog from this breed weighs less than 20 kilograms? Use the Z table to find the probability.

## Solution
To solve this problem, we'll:
1. Calculate the Z-Score using the formula \( Z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma} \), where \( X = 20 \) kilograms, \( \mu = 25 \) kilograms, and \( \sigma = 3 \) kilograms.
2. Look up the Z-Score in the Z table to determine the probability.

## Result
The probability that a randomly selected dog from this breed weighs less than 20 kilograms is approximately 4.75%.
