# Hypothesis-Testing-probability

# Probability of Assembly Time Exceeding 30 Minutes

## Problem Statement
To find the probability that a randomly chosen assembly takes more than 30 minutes, we'll use the standard normal distribution (Z-distribution) with the given mean and standard deviation.

## Solution
1. **Calculate Z-Score**: Using \( Z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma} \), where \( X = 30 \) minutes, \( \mu = 25 \) minutes, and \( \sigma = 4 \) minutes, we get \( Z = 1.25 \).
2. **Find Probability**: Looking up the Z-table, we find the probability associated with a Z-score of approximately 1.25 to be 0.8944.
3. **Final Probability**: Since the total area under the curve is 1, the probability of \( X > 30 \) is \( 1 - 0.8944 = 0.1056 \).

## Result
The probability that a randomly chosen assembly takes more than 30 minutes is approximately 0.1056, or 10.56%.
